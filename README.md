# Diploma-Thesis
“Development of an on-Board Diagnostics (OBD) System”

These are the source codes so far used for my arduino based system developped in the context of my Diploma Thesis.

The device is capable of tracking the gps location of the user as well as their speed, acceleration and decelaration
and then record it on a micro sd card or transmit it over UDP.

The device is a work in progress and is being developed on a custom board designed by me which is based on the ESP8266 microcontroller.
